## 💻 Tech Stack

**Skills I actively misuse:**
- Problem Creating  
- Critical Crashing  
- Data Destruction  
- Machine Forgetting  
- Cloud Confusion  
- Cyber Insecurity  
- Version Chaos  
- Fragile Development  
- Team Sabotage  
- Rebugging (fixing bugs so they come back worse)  
- Tux Paint (advanced)  
- Sticky Notes (enterprise-grade)  
- Understood Interstellar (briefly, then forgot)

Nothing here scales. Nothing here lasts.

## 🔝 Least Contributed Repo

The one with the most potential.  
Abandoned quietly. Like everything else.

---

## 🐌 Productivity Meter

Barely moving.  
Occasionally backward.  
Mostly observing time pass.

---

## 🧨 Current Projects

- Breaking working code for no reason  
- Turning stable builds into chaos  
- Hosting apps on grandma’s Windows XP PC  
- Asking *“why does this even work?”* and then fixing that

## 🕳️ Philosophy

Code doesn’t rot.  
People do.  
Repositories just document it.

Every commit is a confession.  
Every rollback is regret.

---

## 📉 Status

Maintaining bugs so they don’t feel lonely.  
Shipping entropy.  
Waiting for the heat death of this repo.
